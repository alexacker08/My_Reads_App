# The Book Shelf React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Quick Overview
Welcome to the simplest and most unique “My Reads” application on the internet today. You may find other similar applications out there, but trust me….this is the best one.

### So what will I be able to do with this app?
* Keep track of all the books in your life that you have read, want to read, and or are currently reading.
* Search for new books to add to your BookShelf via the super magic Bookshelf API. (Warning search queries limited. [Click here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) to view options. Okay so maybe not so super..but I mean..it has the potential.)
* Get detailed information on the the books in your searches including really important things like, the number of pages, the publisher, and a link Google Book for more information.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexnitro/My_Reads_App.git

npm install

npm start
```

Running NPM Start should kick start your browser to open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where you'll then be able to use your own Bookshelf.

## How to Use

Congrats on getting the app up and running. Now that you have your browser open, the application will give you some initial books to start plaing around with.

* Click on the drop down arrow and select a particular shelf for where you like your book to go.
* Want to add a new book to your Bookshelf? Click on the plus button in the lower right which will then send you to the search page.
* You can filter your books in your shelf by clicking on the filter button and then selecting a filter type.
* Once in the search page, conduct a search using one of the [queries provided](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). Based on your search, relevant books will appear that you can then add to your Bookshelf.
* If you click on an individual book yourself, a modal will open with more information about that book.
* To add a book to your bookshelf, just make a selection from the individual book dropdown and PRESTO, the book has been moved and categorized properly in your bookshelf.
